YO. I goes by the name "zeqzoq". Sometimes in CTFs I use "worstcfplayer" inpired by worsthrplayer in Osu!. Currently a final year student at UniKL MIIT, Malaysia, taking Computer System Security, or cybersecurity for short. And I'm the president of the cybersecurity club. I started my internship with Hilti Asia IT Services (HAITS). I play CTFs, but planning to retire once I got into internship or my first job, as I want to focuses more on developing specific skills for the job. Did I use AI to solve the challenges? Very YES. And I abuse it. But its just to win the local competitive CTFs. The weekly ctfs will be my training time. But it depends on my mood that day... Outside of work, my schedule as of now is going to work > work > go back home > sleep > going back home. For the weekend, I'll play ctfs or I'll play games or sleep.
