YO. I goes by the name "zeqzoq". Sometimes in CTFs I use "worstcfplayer" inpired by worsthrplayer in Osu!. Currently a final year student at UniKL MIIT, Malaysia, taking Computer System Security, or cybersecurity. And yes I'm the president of he cybersecurity club. As of now, I am still searching for internship. I did play CTFs for fun, and planning to retire once I got into internship or my first job, as I want to focuses more on developing specific skills for the job. As for me, CTFs are just like quiz competition, the one who solved the most challenge wins. But with era of AI, when playing competitive CTFs, its more like I want to win so I use AI mostly and not learn anything. So the weekend CTFs really helped me to take my time to learn at my pace. That's why I play CTFs every weekend. But for competitive CTFs? Hell Yea I'll use AI to win.
